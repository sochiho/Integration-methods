# Calculus excercises

CDM_diff.py - performs numerical differentiation using the centre difference method. A plot is shown using different step sizes dx.

Numerical.py - performs numerical integration with a plot to show the percentage error in the numerical method vs the number of panels used.

MC_INTEGRATOR.py - A simple Monte carlo integrator.

ODE_exp_decay.py - Generate decay curve for Iodine-133 analytically and numerically with half-life 20.8 hrs. Function uses both the Euler and Heun method to solve the differential equation. Data is plotted against the analytic solution and the error of the two methods is plotted.

ODE2_SHM.py - A program to study the harmonic motion of a simple pendulum for which the small angle approximation is valid. The Euler method is used to solve the ODE along with scipy.integrate.odeint black box function. The two methods are compared.
